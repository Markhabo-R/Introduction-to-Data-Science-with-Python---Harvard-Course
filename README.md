# Introduction-to-Data-Science-with-Python---Harvard-Course
Introduction to Data Science with Python - Harvard Course.  I have started taking this course on the edX website, and here I will share my notes and related materials as I progress through the content.
Course Description!
In this course you'll learn the basics of data modeling, from nearest-neighbor approaches and simple linear models to intermediate techniques like Ridge and LASSO. You'll learn about model selection, how to avoid overfitting, and some of the most common mistakes people make in data science. By the end you'll be prepared to move into more advanced courses, or maybe even a junior position in the data science industry.
