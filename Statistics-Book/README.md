# An Introduction to Statistical Learning, 2nd edition 
Statistical learning refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data. These
 tools can be classified as supervised or unsupervised. Broadly speaking,
 supervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model for pre
dicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more inputs. Problems of
 this nature occur in fields as diverse as business, medicine, astrophysics, and
 public policy. With unsupervised statistical learning, there are inputs but
 no supervising output; nevertheless we can learn relationships and struc
ture from such data.

Above is income survey info for men from the central Atlantic region of the USA. 
LEFT: Wage as a function of Age: On average teh wage increases till 60 years of age and begins to decrease after that.  Center: Wage as a function of Year: from 2003 TO 2009 There is a slow and steady increase in the wage which is approxiamately $10,000. RIGHT: Wage as a function of Educational Level. It can be observed that these two variables are parallel and the higher the education lever the higher the wage.. 

# 1.1 Clearly, the most accurate prediction of a given man’s wage will be
 obtained bycombining his age,his education,and the year.
we can use linear regression,which can be used to predict wage from this
 dataset.
# 1.2.Ideally,we should predict wage in a way that accounts for the
 non-linear relationship between wage and age.

# 2. Stock Market Data
A wage data involves predicting a continuous or quantitative value whcih is often referred to as 
# Regression problem
However, in certain cases we may wish to predict non-numerical value-that is, a categorical or qualitative output.

Thegoal istopredictwhetherthe indexwill
 increase or decrease onagivenday, using the past 5days’ percentage
 changes in the index.Here the statistical learning problem does not involve
 predicting a numerical value. Instead it involves predicting whether a given
day's stock market performance will fall into the Up bucket or the down buskek.
