# An Introduction to Statistical Learning External link, 2nd edition 
Statistical learning refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data. These
 tools can be classified as supervised or unsupervised. Broadly speaking,
 supervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model for pre
dicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more inputs. Problems of
 this nature occur in fields as diverse as business, medicine, astrophysics, and
 public policy. With unsupervised statistical learning, there are inputs but
 no supervising output; nevertheless we can learn relationships and struc
ture from such data.
